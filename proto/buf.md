### StreamingFast Firehose AElf Types

Protobuf definitions when dealing with Firehose AElf chain(s) like AElf Mainnet and AElf Testnet.

Foremost, this provides [sf.aelf.types.v1.Block](https://buf.build/streamingfast/firehose-aelf/docs/main:sf.aelf.type.v1#sf.aelf.type.v1.Block) which is used for consuming Firehose & Substreams AElf block model.

This is probably the only model you should really care about, the rest are meant for internal communications for Firehose operators.
